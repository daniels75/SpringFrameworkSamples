not deploying the created client filters. [#2218]

==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12.6 ====

1. Enhancements

* Added a new configuration parameter for the Active Directory integration. It is now possible
to configure the LDAP search filter to be used for searching the user.
See the Active Directory Authentication section.
* Added an option to show IMDG clients' IP addresses or canonical host names on the user interface.
See the Monitoring Clients section.
* Added a warning icon for the members on the member listing page, when the number of available processors is
below the recommended value, or when multiple members are running on the same machine. See the Monitoring Members section.

* Fixed an issue where "dev" is listed as a cluster even though there isn't one. [#2179]
* Fixed an issue where the JMX connector didn't shut down properly on application server shutdown. [#2004]

3. Behavioral Changes

* Existing Active Directory integrations will break as a result
of upgrading to Management Center 3.12.6. You need to update your
`ldap.properties` file as instructed below.

Find the following line:

```
userSearchFilter=uid\={0}
```

Replace it with the following one:

```
userSearchFilter=(&(objectClass\=user)(userPrincipalName\={0}))
```

After updating the file, you need to either restart
Management Center or reload the security configuration.

==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12.5 ====

1. Enhancements

* Introduced the new "Client Near Cache" table
for the map and cache data structures which shows information about all the clients
with Near Cache for that data structure. See
Client Near Cache Data Table in the Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual.

* Aligned the data in the tables vertically with their column headings.
Columns in the tables are now either right aligned or left aligned
(chart headers are centered). [#2030]

2. Fixes

the `map`/`member` property value. Additional boolean properties named
`allMaps`/`allMembers` were added to those events to mitigate this. [#2027]
* Fixed a visual issue on the Member screen when Edge is used. [#1983]

==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12.3 ====

1. Enhancements

* Persistent row count: The number of displayed rows
in the Management Center is now persisted to your preferred browser's
local storage. Before, when you change the default value (5 rows)
and relaunch the Management Center, it was reset to 5 rows again.
Note that this enhancement is valid when you use the same browser
for relaunching the Management Center. [#1976]

2. Fixes

* There was a memory leak warning when the Management Center
is deployed to Tomcat. This has been fixed by closing and removing
unclosed/unused thread pools and executor services. [#1999]
* Fixed an issue where the dashboard screen was crashing
when the cluster has more than 12 members. [#1990]
* Fixed an issue where IMap's lock counts were not shown
on the Management Center for non-existent keys. [#1944]

==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12.1 ====

1. New Features

* Introduced basic management operations for CP Subsystem including
promoting a member to become a CP member, removing CP members from the subsystem
and restarting the whole CP subsystem.See the CP Subsystem section
for more information.

2. Enhancements

* The "To enter the Management Center license, go to ..." hint
on the "License" screen is now available only to the admin users.
[#1887]
* Introduced a notification warning when the Management Center user
interface could not connect to its backend since, for example, its
server is down. [#1856]
* Added the "publisher ID" information to the WAN replication screen
so that you can perform the "WAN Sync" operation in case separate
publisher IDs are configured for WAN publishers. [#1839]
* Added a loading splash during the initial launch for unauthenticated
users and introduced a popup dialog to inform the users
that their sessions are expired. [#1830]
* Improved the percentage charts so that they now have predefined
vertical axes (y-axes) instead of dynamically ranged values in them.
[#1806]
* Added the "delete configuration" button to the "Set up SMTP
Server" dialog. [#1800]
* Added the "clear history" button to the screen where all the previous
instances of an alert are shown (alert history screen). [#1799]
* Introduced a clustered JMX MBean showing which clusters are
being monitored by a Management Center instance. [#1793]
* Replaced the pie charts on the dashboard screen with the stacked
bar charts. [#1602]
* Added a text field to the page navigation part so that you
can type the number of a page you want to view. [#1437]
* The users are now redirected to the cluster selection dialog
upon a successful cluster shutdown operation. [#1354]

3. Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the "Hazelcast Management Center successfully
started at..." log output was not going through a custom logging
framework, but only `System.out`. [#1863]
* Fixed an issue where all the privileged (Metrics, Read-Only, Read-Write)
non-admin users could change WAN publisher's state, and none of them could
start a WAN synchronization and add WAN configuration.
Now, the non-admin users with Read-Write privilege can perform these operations
and they are the only ones who can change WAN publisher's state. [#1858]
* Fixed an issue where the WAN synchronization or consistency check
was failing silently when the cluster is in the passive state. [#1849]
* Fixed an issue where the names of clients were not shown on
Management Center 3.12 (when Hazelcast IMDG cluster version is 3.12
and client is 3.11, or cluster is 3.11 and client is 3.12). [#1828]
* Fixed an issue where the Management Center user interface was not
redirecting the unauthorized users, who try to launch the interface using
a non-default URL, to the login page. [#1749]
* Fixed the following security issues:
** Changing an account's password was not verifying the user's authenticity.
** The default configuration for the initial deployment of Management Center
on Docker uses an unencrypted channel (TSL/SSL is not enabled by default).
** The Management Center web application
*** was disclosing software name and version details in the HTTP responses
*** did not have the `SameSite` attribute set on  the JSESSIONID session cookies
*** did not set a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the responses.

4. Behavioral Changes

* The "Users" tab in the "Administration" screen is no longer shown when a
security provider other than the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/3.12.1/manual/html/#default-authentication[default one]
is configured.


==== Hazelcast Management Center 3.12 ====

1. New Features

* Introduced the Management Center Configuration (`mc-conf`) tool which
is a command line utility that allows you to update certain parts of the
Management Center configuration by using its built-in commands, including
creating the users externally and resetting security configurations. See
the Management Center Configuration Tool chapter for more information.
* Added support for blue/green deployments. Management Center curates
blacklisted and whitelisted clients that are allowed/not allowed to
connect to the cluster. Hazelcast IMDG members receive the information
about the active lists from the Management Center (during startup and later
on) and apply it for all the current and future clients.
* Added nested group support for Active Directory and LDAP logins so that
the nested groups have the same privileges of their parent group. See the
Authentication Options chapter for more information.
* The Members page now shows which members have CP data structures.

=== Enhancements

* Placed cross-references on the License and Manage License pages targeting each other. [#1550]
* Added the ability to enable the health check from the command line independently of the TLS/SSL settings. [#1359]
* The numeric columns have been made sortable on the Status page tables. [#1312]
* The fields of the notifications in the WAN Sync page are now searchable. [#1235]
* Improved the look and feel behavior of the Scripting and Time Travel pages. [#1148, #1151]
* The warning log for clustered REST API when the cluster is not found is now more descriptive. [#1101]
* Improved the readability of chart legends. [#1078]
* Improved the user interface behavior when it is resized. [#1073, #1246]
* The process for shutting down a member, now, does not require the group password. [#936]
* Introduced timestamp information for the JMX output of WAN replication. [#611]
* Removed an obsolete map configuration metric (Eviction Percentage) from the interface. [#549]


=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the user's session was being marked as invalid when trying to re-login. [#1710]
* Fixed the statistics aggregation in WAN replication JMX API for multiple clusters. [#1704]
* Fixed an issue where the refreshing a page resulted in loading the Management Center dashboard
page, instead of the current page. [#1703]
* Fixed an issue where the time travel files were not deleted for clusters that have a dash in their names. [#1691]

do not represent a count. [#1272]
* Fixed an issue where some of the chart views were showing a time value before 0.0. [#1220]
* Fixed an issue where the Management Center was still showing the statistics for 2
member even the user does not have a license key. Now the statistics are not shown. [#1116]
* Fixed an issue where a non-existing map was not returning any error messages in Clustered REST. [#1090]
* Fixed an issue where the `/` and `.` characters in the map and queue names were causing exceptions
or unexpected behaviors when using Clustered REST. [#1089, [#1091, #1576]
* Fixed an issue where changing the `backup-count` for a map was not resulting in the expected behavior. [#784]
* Fixed an issue where the user interface was not refreshing when changing data using its console. [#498]
